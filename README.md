ShopEasy is a comprehensive e-commerce website that allows users to browse and purchase a variety of products. The website features a catalog of products, a shopping cart, and user authentication for login and signup. The goal is to create a user-friendly shopping experience while implementing essential web development concepts.

### Key Features:

2. *Shopping Cart*: Allow users to add products to their cart, update quantities, and view the total cost.
3. *User Authentication*: Provide secure login and signup options for users.
4. *Product Search and Filters*: Enable users to search for products and apply filters based on categories, price range, etc.
5. *Order Management*: Allow users to place orders, view order history, and track their orders.
